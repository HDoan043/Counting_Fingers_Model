# **ABOUT THIS REPO**
<br><br>

This is a basic neural network model which includes some basic fully connected layers with softmax layer. This model is builded with the aim of counting fingers represented in an image of hand.

The model uses model in **Mediapipe** to detect and predict landmark points of hands in an image. The coordinates of these landmark points are input of the model. And the model will classify it belonging to which class in 6 classes `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` which represent the number of fingers in a hand.
